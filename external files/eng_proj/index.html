                <h1>Inspiration</h1>
                <p>My paper covers the idea of remastered games. When I was younger, I was given a DS for my 6th birthday. I loved playing Mario Bros., where I would pass the DS around with my Dad. I continued to play these titles, and I loved playing video games to which I started coding on my computer. Although I would love to code video games. I turned to coding little programs for fun. Now, I am CS major. Since I am older now, games that I used to play are being remastered, which now looking back at these titles, I feel nostalgic for them. Thus, that is why I focused on nostalgia and video games because I enjoyed them when I was younger </p>

                <h1>Research Findings</h1>
                <p>After researching, I understood that a person may want to play remastered titles to reconnect with their past self. Their past self thus played these older titles when they were first released.</p>

                <h1>The Counterargument</h1>
                <p>I noticed that many people commented that these remastered games are poisoning the gaming industry as it is a repeat of reusing older gameplay and mechanics. However, if the main reason for some is to enjoy their experience and reconnect with their past self, I believe it is ok if there is a little repetition. </p>

            <p>I decided to remediate using a website as I have been learning web development programming languages to further my knowledge in CS. Thus, I feel like this project was a nice challenge. </p>
